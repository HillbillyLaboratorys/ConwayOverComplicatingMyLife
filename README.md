# THE GAME OF LIFE

This is just a glorified screen saver. 

### Life 0.0.2
* Linux implementaion remains unchanged, but the Windows implementaion now has
  console api calls and nolonger useses 2d arrays. 
### Life 0.0.1a
* Linux implementation is... sufficient, but Windows is pretty unacceptable 
  someone is gonna cease.
